# PythonNetworkManager
A simple network manager made with python. It demonstrates some basic abilities with the socket module like transferring files, sending messages, and executing commands on a client. Note that I am a beginner so it is not the best project.

It does have some basic error handling but not every error is covered so it does have some bugs, maybe I will add a better error handling in the future. 
The purpose of this project (other than a final project for a python course) is to demonstrate some of the things you can do with the socket module. 

In this project you can:
  - See all the connected clients.
  - Chat with a client (a very basic chat, you send a message and wait untill you get a message in order to send another message)
  - Execute terminal commands on the system.
  - Send files to a client or download files from him if you have the full path of the file (you can get it by executing commands on the client).

You can modify this project however you want and do with it whatever you want if you find something to use it for.
